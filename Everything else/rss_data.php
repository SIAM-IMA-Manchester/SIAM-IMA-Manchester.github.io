                      <p>Auto Trader is the largest digital car marketplace with headquarters in

                      Auto Trader will present two mathematical problems that arise in his
                      work. There will then be a computer lab session where we will work in
                      groups to come up with creative solutions to these problems. The
                      workshop will conclude with a discussion session, with free food
                      provided.</p>


                      <p>No prior mathematical or programming knowledge is necessary, and this
